# GraphQL Opentracing

Open Tracing instrumentation for the [graphql gem](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby). By default it starts a new span for every request handled by graphql. It follows the open tracing tagging [semantic conventions](https://opentracing.io/specification/conventions)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'graphql-opentracing'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install graphql-opentracing

## Usage
First load the opentracing (Note: this won't automatically instrument the graphql gem)
```
require "graphql-opentracing"
```

If you have setup `OpenTracing.global_tracer` you can turn on spans for all requests with just:
```
    GraphQL::Tracer.instrument
```

Under the hood the gem subscribes to graphql instrumentation events through ActiveSupport notifications framework. If you find the number of spans too noisy you can control which spans are reported though a callback like:
```
GraphQl::Tracer.instrument(
    tracer: tracer,
    ignore_request: ->(name, started, finished, id, data) {  name == 'graphql.lex' }
)
```

If you have a bespoke way of passing errors in the response that is not part of context errors you can detect errors for tagging your spans through a callback:
```
GraphQl::Tracer.instrument(
    tracer: tracer,
    check_errors: ->(name, started, finished, id, data) { data[:context] == "whatever" }
)
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bundle install` to install dependencies. Then, run `rspec` to run the tests.
